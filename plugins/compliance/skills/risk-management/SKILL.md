# Risk Management Skill

Frameworks for compliance program design, risk assessment, and regulatory adherence in Korean and international business contexts.

## Enterprise Risk Assessment Framework

### Risk Identification Categories

Systematically scan across these risk domains:

| Domain | Key Risk Types |
|---|---|
| **Regulatory / Legal** | Licensing, permits, sector-specific regulations, cross-border compliance |
| **Financial** | Fraud, misstatement, tax non-compliance, sanctions exposure |
| **Operational** | Process failure, vendor dependency, business continuity |
| **Data / Privacy** | Personal data breach, unauthorized processing, cross-border transfer |
| **Reputational** | ESG violations, media exposure, social media incidents |
| **Cybersecurity** | Ransomware, insider threat, third-party breach |
| **HR / Employment** | Wage/hour violations, discrimination, workplace safety |
| **Contractual** | Breach of contract, IP infringement, non-compete violations |

### Risk Scoring Matrix

Rate each identified risk on two dimensions:

**Likelihood** (1–5):
| Score | Label | Frequency |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Rare | < once every 5 years |
| 2 | Unlikely | Once every 2-5 years |
| 3 | Possible | Once per year |
| 4 | Likely | Several times per year |
| 5 | Almost certain | Monthly or more |

**Impact** (1–5):
| Score | Label | Business Effect |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Negligible | < ₩10M loss, no external attention |
| 2 | Minor | ₩10-100M loss, internal escalation only |
| 3 | Moderate | ₩100M-1B loss, limited regulatory attention |
| 4 | Major | ₩1-10B loss, regulatory action, media coverage |
| 5 | Critical | > ₩10B loss, criminal liability, license revocation |

**Risk Score = Likelihood × Impact**

| Score | Risk Level | Response |
|---|---|---|
| 1–4 | Low | Monitor, document |
| 5–9 | Medium | Assign owner, quarterly review |
| 10–16 | High | Immediate action plan, monthly review |
| 17–25 | Critical | Escalate to board, external counsel |

## Korean Regulatory Compliance

### Key Korean Laws for Business Compliance

| Law | Scope | Penalty Range |
|---|---|---|
| 개인정보 보호법 (PIPA) | Personal data collection, processing, transfer | ₩10-50M fine, 5년 이하 징역 |
| 공정거래법 | Anti-competitive behavior, unfair trade | Revenue-based surcharge up to 10% |
| 전자상거래법 | E-commerce disclosures, refund policies | ₩1-3M fine |
| 근로기준법 | Labor standards, working hours, wage | ₩10-30M fine, 2년 이하 징역 |
| 정보통신망법 | Online privacy, cybersecurity | ₩100M fine, business suspension |
| 중대재해처벌법 | Workplace safety for 50+ employees | CEO criminal liability |
| 공익신고자보호법 | Whistleblower protection | Mandatory reinstatement |

### PIPA Compliance Checklist

## Internal Controls Framework

### Control Types

| Control Type | Timing | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Preventive** | Before the event | Access controls, segregation of duties |
| **Detective** | During or after | Reconciliations, audit trails, anomaly alerts |
| **Corrective** | After detection | Incident response, remediation plans |
| **Directive** | Guiding behavior | Policies, training, code of conduct |

### Segregation of Duties (SoD) — Key Incompatible Functions

| Process | Should NOT be combined |
|---|---|
| Accounts Payable | Invoice approval + payment execution |
| Payroll | Employee setup + payroll processing |
| Procurement | Vendor selection + purchase approval |
| IT | System development + production access |
| Finance | Journal entry + account reconciliation |

### Control Testing Cadence

| Control Risk Level | Testing Frequency | Sample Size |
|---|---|---|
| High | Quarterly | 25 items per quarter |
| Medium | Semi-annual | 15 items per period |
| Low | Annual | 10 items per year |

## Compliance Program Design

### Program Pillars (7 Elements — Based on US Sentencing Guidelines / Korean Standards)

1. **Standards and Procedures** — Written policies covering key risk areas
2. **Program Oversight** — Designated compliance officer with board visibility
3. **Training and Education** — Role-based annual training, new hire onboarding
4. **Monitoring and Auditing** — Risk-based audit plan, continuous monitoring tools
5. **Reporting Mechanisms** — Anonymous hotline (신고채널), non-retaliation policy
6. **Enforcement** — Consistent discipline for violations at all levels
7. **Response and Prevention** — Root cause analysis and remediation for incidents

### Compliance Calendar Template

| Month | Activity |
|---|---|
| 1 | Annual risk assessment |
| 2 | Policy review and updates |
| 3 | Q1 control testing |
| 4 | Training completion audit |
| 6 | Q2 control testing + mid-year regulatory scan |
| 9 | Q3 control testing |
| 10 | External audit preparation |
| 12 | Annual compliance report to board |

| P3 | Policy violation, limited impact | 1 week | Department head + Compliance |
| P4 | Minor deviation, self-reported | 1 month | Compliance review only |
