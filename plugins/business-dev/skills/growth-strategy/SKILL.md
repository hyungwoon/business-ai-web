# Growth Strategy Skill

Frameworks for business development, partnership strategy, and new market entry for Korean and global business contexts.

## Business Opportunity Assessment Framework

### 1. Market Sizing (TAM / SAM / SOM)

| Level | Definition | Method |
|---|---|---|
| TAM (Total Addressable Market) | Total revenue opportunity if 100% market share | Top-down: industry reports, macro data |
| SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market) | Portion you can realistically reach | Bottom-up: segment × price × volume |
| SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market) | Realistic capture in 1-3 years | Benchmarks from comparable entrants |

**Calculation template:**
```
TAM = Total market units × Average price
SAM = TAM × addressable segment %
SOM = SAM × realistic market share % (year 1-3)
```

### 2. Opportunity Scoring Matrix

Score each opportunity on five dimensions (1-5 scale):

| Dimension | Weight | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Market size | 25% | TAM/SAM scale relative to current business |
| Strategic fit | 25% | Alignment with core capabilities and brand |
| Competitive advantage | 20% | Defensibility — moats, IP, relationships |
| Time to revenue | 15% | Speed from deal to first dollar |
| Risk level | 15% | Regulatory, execution, partner dependency |

**Score:** Sum of (dimension score × weight). Prioritize opportunities scoring ≥ 3.5.

## Partnership Framework

### Partnership Types

| Type | Structure | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| Reseller | Partner sells your product for margin | Fast distribution, low upfront cost |
| Co-sell | Joint sales motion with revenue share | Enterprise deals requiring warm intros |
| Technology integration | API/product integration | Ecosystem stickiness, developer reach |
| OEM / White-label | Your tech under partner's brand | Market access with limited brand build |
| Strategic alliance | Joint GTM + co-investment | Major market entry, shared risk |

### Partnership Evaluation Criteria

Before entering any partnership, assess:

1. **Reach** — Does the partner access customers you cannot reach alone?
2. **Credibility** — Does their brand elevate yours?
3. **Alignment** — Are incentives truly aligned, or will conflict emerge?
4. **Exclusivity risk** — Does exclusivity close off better options?
5. **Dependency risk** — If this partner leaves, what is the fallback?

### Partnership Term Sheet Essentials

- Revenue share / commission rate and payment cadence
- Exclusivity scope (geography, segment, duration)
- Minimum performance commitments (MPC) with cure periods
- Intellectual property ownership and licensing terms
- Termination rights and notice periods
- Co-marketing budget and approval rights
- Data sharing and confidentiality obligations

## Go-To-Market (GTM) Planning

### GTM Motion Selection

| Motion | Best When | Key Metric |
|---|---|---|
| Product-led growth (PLG) | Low ACV, high volume, self-serve product | Free → paid conversion rate |
| Sales-led growth (SLG) | High ACV, complex deals, long cycle | Pipeline coverage, win rate |
| Partner-led growth | Distribution gaps, trust barriers | Partner-sourced revenue % |
| Community-led growth | Strong user community, advocacy potential | Community NPS, referral rate |

### GTM Launch Checklist

**Pre-launch (T-90 to T-30):**
- [ ] ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) defined with 3-5 firmographic + behavioral attributes

## Investor & Executive Communication

### Business Case Structure

A compelling business case for new initiatives follows this structure:

2. **Opportunity** — Market size, timing, why we are positioned to win
3. **Proposal** — Specific initiative with scope and success criteria
4. **Investment** — Resources required (people, budget, time)
5. **Return** — Financial projections with assumptions clearly stated
6. **Risks** — Top 3 risks and mitigation plans
7. **Ask** — Clear decision requested with timeline

### Financial Projection Template

```
Year 1    Year 2    Year 3
Revenue:   ₩___M    ₩___M    ₩___M
COGS:      ₩___M    ₩___M    ₩___M
Gross Margin: ___%   ___%     ___%
OpEx:      ₩___M    ₩___M    ₩___M
EBITDA:    ₩___M    ₩___M    ₩___M

## Korean Market Specifics

### Business Culture Considerations

- **관계 (Gwanye) first:** Relationships precede transactions. Budget time for informal meetings (식사, 회식) before business discussions.
- **의사결정 구조:** Many Korean enterprises require senior executive (임원) sign-off. Map decision-makers early.
- **RFP 관행:** Large enterprises often use formal RFP processes. Prepare detailed proposal documents (제안서) with clear pricing tables.
- **현지화 요구사항:** Technology partners often expected to have Korean-language support, local data residency, and Korean engineering contacts.

|---|---|
| 대기업 (Chaebol) | System integrator (SI) partnership or CVC/accelerator program |
